I find joy and fulfillment in working with databases, designing ERDs, optimizing queries, and troubleshooting performance issues. I am motivated to learn more about database technologies and techniques, even outside of formal education or work requirements. So, I created this DBMS for a Retail Store starting from ERDs. I pay close attention to details when working with databases, ensuring that data is structured, organized, and maintained correctly. I envision a career path that revolves around database management, such as database administrator (DBA), data engineer, database developer, or data architect.
